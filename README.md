Hi! My name's Ryan von Rosenberg. Welcome to my portfolio and practice area for my QA/QC test automation. I focus mostly on Playwright and Javascript.

I've been a QA/QC professional for the past 10 years. In my time I've worked with several different technologies, learned numerous methodologies, and grew my talent. Mentoring and being mentored by my peers along the way. I specialize in several testing styles, including: End-to-End, API, Black Box, Gray Box, White Box, Functional, Integration, Acceptance, and Smoke. I have additional experience with UAT and Performance testing.

On the QA process side, I specialize in open and transparent communication. I have often been the most outgoing of my previous QA teams, bringing me forward as the face of the team. I have run lunch-and-learns focused on improving tickets written by anyone in the company by implementing standard procedures; this resulted in faster and more complete triage of new defects and bugs. I have worked with automation engineers to implement QA automation tools and am hard at work improving my own code skills to bring my automation up to speed. I have helped to implement new bug/defect triage priorities, resulting in velocity increases for all bug fixes.

I've been a passionate QA/QC professional ever since I started as an intern at a small game company in St. Louis. In every one of my roles I've continued growing stronger and even more skilled. CareCloud and ShopWare both gave me incredible boosts to my confidence and cemented my love of the QA/QC process even further. Going even so far as to implement a pipeline for support team members to join the QA team, leveraging their incredible knowledge of our system with my knowledge, mentoring them on QA/QC processes. This was so successful that the first support team member to complete the pipeline was quickly promoted to the QA Team Lead. 

I encourage you to reach out and discuss with me how I can help grow your team of quality professionals even further!
