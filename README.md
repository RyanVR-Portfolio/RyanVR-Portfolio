Hi! My name's Ryan von Rosenberg. Welcome to my portfolio and practice area for my QA/QC test automation. I focus mostly on Playwright and JavaScript.

I've been a QA/QC professional for the past 12 years. In my time I've worked with several different technologies, learned numerous methodologies, and grew my talent—mentoring and being mentored by my peers along the way. I specialize in several testing styles, including End-to-End, API, Black Box, Gray Box, White Box, Functional, Integration, Acceptance, and Smoke. I also have additional experience with UAT and Performance testing.

On the QA process side, I specialize in open and transparent communication. I have often been the most outgoing of my previous QA teams, bringing me forward as the face of the team. I’ve run lunch-and-learns focused on improving tickets written by anyone in the company by implementing standard procedures; this resulted in faster and more complete triage of new defects and bugs. I’ve worked with automation engineers to implement QA automation tools and am hard at work improving my own code skills to bring my automation up to speed. I’ve helped implement new bug/defect triage priorities, resulting in velocity increases for all bug fixes.

I've been a passionate QA/QC professional ever since I started as an intern at a small game company in St. Louis. In every one of my roles, I've continued growing stronger and even more skilled. CareCloud and Shop-Ware both gave me incredible boosts to my confidence and cemented my love of the QA/QC process even further—going so far as to implement a pipeline for support team members to join the QA team, leveraging their deep product knowledge with my testing expertise. The first support member to complete that pipeline was quickly promoted to QA Team Lead.

Over the past year, I’ve expanded that same passion into Ashlight QA, my independent consultancy. Through Ashlight, I partner with small teams and startups to strengthen their testing pipelines, establish practical automation coverage using Playwright, and create sustainable QA cultures where quality is everyone’s responsibility—not just QA’s. Whether you’re building a new test strategy from the ground up or need help stabilizing existing automation, my approach focuses on clarity, maintainability, and measurable impact.

I encourage you to reach out and discuss how I can help grow your team of quality professionals even further!
